aprsd 2.1.0 Linux APRS Server program README

The user documentation for this program is in the file
aprsddoc.html.  Use your web browser to read it.


This release fixes several bugs and adds new features.  There are 
new commmands in the aprsd.conf file.  If you are upgrading you will
need to add these to your existing aprsd.conf.	See the example aprsd.conf
for details.

New commands for aprsd.conf.

NetBeacon <interval> <posit> :  Sends an aprs posit from the server to the internet 
                                at regular intervals
	     
TncBeacon <interval> <posit>  :  Sends an aprs posit to the TNC at regular intervals.

igateMyCall: <yes|no> : You own TNCs packets may be igated or not.

MyEmail <email address> : Email address of system operator used in query response 

TncPktSpacing <time in milliseconds> : Sets the minimum time between packets transmitted by the TNC


A new file has been added in your /home/aprsd2 directory.  It's user.deny
and contains a list of users whom you wish to place restrictions on. 
For example:
W4EVIL L    <-- This prevents logon, ie: user is read-only
W4HACK R    <-- This prevents RF transmission

This version also uses a different /etc/rc.d/init.d/aprsd.init file.
BE SURE YOUR OLD FILE IS REPLACED BY THE NEW ONE! The ./INSTALLDAEMON
script will replace it while not touching your configuration files in /home/aprsd2/ .

**Important**
RedHat 6.0 (2.2 kernel) users will need to compile the source to get
an executable suited for their system.  Just type "make" in
the distribution directory. If you don't do this aprsd will seg fault
and die on the first user connection.

REVISIONS 2.1.0    6-22-1999

1) Fixed the code so it runs properly as a daemon.  
   See added function "daemonInit()" in aprsd.cpp.
   Also modified aprsd.init .
   To run as a daemon enter: ./aprsd -d 
   To run as a program enter: ./aprsd
   

2) Added logic to handle MD5 password encryption in the validate module.
   Now it works with RedHat 6.0 shadowed MD5 passwords.
   
3) Added "#include <errno.h>" statements in history.cpp and aprsd.cpp.
   Now it now compiles under RedHat 6.0.
   
4) Changed logic so messages sent on RF also are sent to other Internet users.
   I needed to do this so messages to wild card groups such as "SCOUTS"
   go both to RF and the remainder of the users and igates.
   
5) New Feature: The server now responds to the "?IGATE?" query.

6) New Feature: You can put system abusers in the "user.deny" file and
   deny access to  RF or prevent them from logging on.
   
7) New Feature: You can configure the server to ignore  packets which were
   transmitted from your own TNC.  The previous versions always igated
   your own TNCs packets. Use the command line "igateMyCall no" in aprsd.conf
   to turn off igateing of your own TNCs packets.
   
8) Fixed bug that caused the history list dump to abort and disconnect user
   after about 700 items had been sent.
   
9) Fixed two bugs in aprsString and raw-user send code.  Now mic_e packets
   come out in raw format on port 14580 .
   
10) Changed the servers status messages to the new format.
    eg: "aprsdATL>APRS,TCPIP*::USERLIST :Verified user W4HAM has logged on."
    Note the extra colon after TCPIP* and the lack of a message number on the end
    to indicate we don't expect an ack.
    
11) Fixed speed related problem in SendToAllClients() function that caused
    overflows of the Internet send queue.  The server can now handle many
    more users at higher data rates.
    
12) Added command "TncPktSpacing" to the aprsd.conf file. This command takes
    one parameter which is the number of milliseconds between packets sent to the
    TNC.  Queued packets to be transmitted will be spaced out at least by
    this number of milliseconds.  The default is 1500 (1.5 seconds).
