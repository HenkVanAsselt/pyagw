<h3>REVISIONS 2.1.0 Pre-Releases 1 to 7<br> 6-20-1999</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fixed the code so it runs properly as a daemon.  
   See added function "daemonInit()" in code.
   Also modified aprsd.init .
   To run as a daemon enter: ./aprsd -d 
   To run as a program enter: ./aprsd <p>
   

<li> Added logic to handle MD5 password encryption in the validate module.
   Now it works with RedHat 6.0 shadowed MD5 passwords.<p>
   
<li> Added "#include &#60errno.h&#62" statements in history.cpp and aprsd.cpp.
   Now it now compiles under RedHat 6.0. <p>
   
<li> Changed logic so messages sent on RF also are sent to other Internet users.
   Needed to do this so messages to wild card groups such as "SCOUTS"
   go both to RF and the remainder of the users and igates. <p>
   
<li> New Feature: The server now responds to the "?IGATE?" query. <p>

<li>New Feature: You can put system abusers in the "user.deny" file and
   deny access to  RF or prevent them from logging on. <p>
   
<li>New Feature: You can configure the server to ignore  packets which were
transmitted from your own TNC.  The previous versions always igated
your own TNCs packets. Use the command line "igateMyCall no" in aprsd.conf
to turn off igateing of your own TNCs packets. <p>
   
<li>Fixed bug that caused the history list dump to abort and disconnect user
   after about 700 items had been sent. <p>
   
<li> Fixed two bugs in aprsString and raw-user send code.  Now mic_e packets
   come out in raw format on port 14580 . <p>
   
<li>Changed the servers status messages to the new format. <br>
    eg: "aprsdATL>APRS,TCPIP*::USERLIST :Verified user W4HAM logged on using MacAPRS 3.2.0."<br>
    Note the extra colon after TCPIP* and the lack of a message number on the end
    to indicate we don't expect an ack. <p>
    
<li>Fixed speed related problem in SendToAllClients() function that caused
    overflows of the Internet send queue.  The server can now handle many
    more users at higher data rates. <p>

 <li>Added command "TncPktSpacing" to the aprsd.conf file. This command takes
    one parameter which is the number of milliseconds between packets sent to the
    TNC.  Queued packets to be transmitted will be spaced out at least by
    this number of milliseconds.  The default is 1500 (1.5 seconds). <p>



   
 
</ul>

<p>
<h3> 2.0.9 changes</h3>
Changed the validate code so validate is compiled into the
aprsd executable instead of being a separate program.  This
improves both speed and security.

 <p>
 <h3>2.0.8</h3>
<ul>
<li> 2.0.8 Fixed a security problem with logons. It was possible
   in earlier versions to "be creative" with user and password
   strings to pass commands to a Linux shell.
<li> Cleaned up some serial interface code which may 
   have been causing trouble with mic_e packets on some systems.
<li> New Feature: Added msgdest2rf keyword in aprsd.conf file.  See below for details. 
</ul>


<p>
<h3> ** IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 2.0.6 ** </h3>
The new INSTALL scripts, INSTALLDAEMON and INSTALLPGM
have been enhanced to look for existing aprsd configuration files
and not overwrite them. You should save copies of these files anyway
in case something goes wrong. <br>
<ul>
<li>welcome.txt
<li>aprsd.conf
<li>INIT.TNC
<li>RESTORE.TNC
</ul>

<h3>DESCRIPTION </h3>
This is an APRS Internet server program.  It acts as a gateway between
the Internet and a local ham VHF APRS packet network. It is interfaced to
directly to a TNC via one of the PC serial ports and does not use the Linux
ax25 sockets interface. <p>

It has only been tested on RedHat Linux 5.1 , 5.2, 6.0 and Mandrake 5.3.  It requires libstdc++ 2.8.0 or later
to run.  It will NOT run on RedHat 4.2. <p>

The program gets data from a TNC connected to a serial port
and sends it to all clients who have connected to any of several user
defined tcp ports. Some defaults are 1313, 10151, 10152 and 14579.	 
It was designed to duplicate most if not all of the functionality of
APRServe, a Macintosh APRS server designed and coded by Steve Dimse, K4HG.<br>
<a href="http://www.aprs.net/aprserve.dcc.html"> See http://www.aprs.net/aprserve.dcc.html</a> <br>
It can also gate data coming from the Internet to the TNC for
transmission on the local VHF RF network.<p>


<h4>CLIENT SOFTWARE</h4>
Users can connect using several client programs such as Mac/WinAPRS,
javAPRS and Telnet.  The logon protocol used by Mac/WinAPRS is recognized
and properly handled giving registered users the privilige of sending
3rd party messages into the local VHF network. <p>

Clients can use telnet to watch TNC data.<br>
eg: telnet www.wa4dsy.radio.org 14579 <br>
If raw TNC data is desired port 14580 can be used.<p>

Scripts written in languages such as perl can connect to the
server and interact with the data. A UDP port is provided to simplify
injection of data into the aprs stream by scripts. <p>

The system operator can use telnet to monitor the server status
by connecting to any port and enter entering his Linux user name, password
and entering "monitor" for the version field.  Also he can enter remote
sysop mode and gain direct control of the TNC. <br>
eg: user WA4ZZZ pass 12345 vers monitor
<p>


<h4>HISTORY LIST</h4>
A history of data from the TNC and IGATES going back 30 minutes (time also user defined) is kept in
memory and delivered to each user when he connects.  This
history data is filtered to remove duplicates and certain
other unwanted information.  Duplicate data are detected by looking
for any packets with the same data and source call sign that have
been seen in the last 30 seconds. When duplicates are found they are discarded.<p>

There is also a quota system to further reduce the quanity of data in the history list.
Each AX25 source call sign is allowed three packets in the history
list.  One position report, one weather report and one "other".	Only the
most receint of each type is retained. <p>

<h3>INSTALLING AS A DAEMON</h3
<em> (** also see Installing as a Program below **) </em><br>
<ul>
<li>Login as root.

<li>Copy the archive into your home directory.

<li>Issue the following command:

<li>tar zxvf aprsd210.tar.gz

<li>Of course you already did it or you wouldn't be reading this ;-)

<li>cd aprsd210

<LI>make  (required for RedHat 6 but ok for any version)

<li>./INSTALLDAEMON

<li>cd /home/aprsd2

<li>Now make any changes you may require to these files (in /home/aprsd2/): <br>
Note: The install program will not overwrite these if they already exist.
 <ul>   
   <li> aprsd.conf
   <li> user.deny
   <li> welcome.txt
   <li>INIT.TNC
   <li>RESTORE.TNC
 </ul>
</ul>    


Make sure the "mycall" line in aprsd.conf
matches the "MYCALL" parameter in the INIT.TNC file.<p>

<ul>
</ul>

At this point INSTALL has created a directory
/home/aprsd2/ and copied several files
into it.  It also has copied aprsd.init 
to various /etc/rc.d/ directories. <p>

<hr>
</a>


 

<a name="running">
<h3>Starting and Stopping the Server</h3>

After you run INSTALL the server will start when the machine is booted up.
To start without rebooting cd to /etc/rc.d/init.d and run the aprsd.init 
script with "start" as the parameter.  eg:  ./aprsd.init start <p>

You can also start it as a daemon by using the -d option. eg: ./aprsd -d <p>

The serial device for TNC data and tcp port numbers are set in the
/home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file.  You can edit this file in the directory you used
to uncompress the distribution files then run INSTALL to make the
changes effective.  INSTALL also will copy the distribution welcome.txt,
INIT.TNC and RESTORE.TNC to /home/aprsd so be sure you make changes to
these in the distribution directory before running INSTALL. <p>


To stop the server go to the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory and
enter "./aprsd.init stop".  To restart enter "./aprsd.init start" . <p>
<hr>

<h3>RUNNING AS A PROGRAM </h3>

The server can be run as a regular program for testing purposes or if you
don't want it to auto start when Linux boots. <p>

First, stop the aprsd daemon by entering: /etc/rc.d/init.d/aprsd.init stop .<p>

It can be re-started as a user program changing to the /home/aprsd2 directory
and typing its name " ./aprsd "  Note: you will need to be logged on
as root unless your user name has write priviliges on the directory /home/aprsd2
and all the files in it.<p>

If you want to be able to log on as remote sysop and take control of the
TNC you will need to add a "tnc" group to the /etc/group file.
See "REMOTE TNC SYSOP ACCESS" below for more details.<p>

 <hr> 
 </a>
 
<a name="program">      

<h3>INSTALLING AS A PROGRAM </h3>
    (You may want to do this first to try it out)<p>

<ul>
<li>Login as root.

<li>Copy the archive into your home directory.

<li>Issue the following commands:
<ul>

<li>tar zxvf aprsd210.tar.gz
<li>cd aprsd210
<LI>make  (required for RedHat 6 but ok for any version)
<li>./INSTALLPGM
<li>cd /home/aprsd2
</ul>
   Now make any changes you may require to welcome.txt, INIT.TNC, RESTORE.TNC
   and aprsd.conf to reflect your call sign, location and TNC paramters.
<br>
Note: The install program will not overwrite these if they already exist.


</ul>
The program and configuration files are copied to /home/aprsd2.
You will need to change the permissions on /home/aprsd2 and all the files
in it if you want to run it as a user other than root.  The Linux password
validator will only work if aprsd run as root.

<a name="commandline">
<h3>COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS</h3>

The server has two command line arguments, the name of the server configuration
file and one switch "-d" for daemon mode.  If no file name is provided the server
 will use /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf . <p>

While running, once each minute this server will emit a status message to the console.
Also, it tells you each time it sends out a packet and to how many users.  It
also shows you what it's sending to the TNC.  One field in the status message
is aprsString Objs.  This is a debugging tool to help find memory leaks.  It should
be no more than 1 or 2 higher than the History items field. Sometimes it will
read much higher but should return to a difference of 1 or 2 within a minute or so.<p>

Ctrl-C or "q" will shut down the server in an
 orderly manner and save the current history
list (last 30 mins of select received data) to disk.<p>

<hr>
</a>


<a name="configfile">
<h3>SERVER CONFIGURATION FILE </h3>

The default configuration file is /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf.  The file is read
on start up.  Lines starting with "#" are comments and are ignored.  Documentation
on syntax and key words are in the file.  More information on the tcpip ports used
by the server can be found in <a href="ports.html"> ports.html</a> <p>

<h4>igateMyCall</h4>
The "igateMyCall &#60yes|no&#62" command is new in version 2.1.0 . If the "yes"
option is chosen packets sent from your TNC and digipeated will be igated to 
the Internet.  If you have a beacon sending the same position as in your
NetBeacon both will be overlayed and unreadable on the users map.  If you must
igate your own TNC beacons you can offset the location of one of them
about .02 north or south so they show as separate objects.<p>

<h3>IGATE PORTS </h3>


The "igate" commands in the configuration file above define the distant APRServe and
other IGATES you want to establish connections to.  You may choose zero or more.  Duplicate
data will not be relayed to your users.  Connections which drop will be reestablished
automatically.  After a connection drops it will attempt to reconnect after 1 minute.
If that attempt fails it will try again in 2 minutes. The time will double each time
until it hits 16 minutes.  Then it will retry forever at 16 minute intervals.
These connection attempts appear in the aprsd.log file. <p>

Which ports on the distant igates do you connect to?  There are two ways to go.
You can connect to the ports which emit only local data (APRServe 1313 or 
aprsmon 14580) or you can choose one reliable server and connect
to the port which supplies the complete data stream (APRServe 23 or aprsd 10152).
In either case it should be a port which doesn't do the history file dump when
you first connect.   Connecting to local ports on ALL other servers will be more
reliable since a single failure won't cut off all your external data. <p>

This server has a port (1314) which only supplies station to station messages and corresponding
posits.  Other servers which will be used ONLY to relay 3rd party station to station
messages to their local VHF network may want to connect to this port to greatly
reduce the amount of data on their tcpip connection. <p>

<a name="comports">
<h3>
COM PORT CONFIGURATION
</h3>  	
The TNC COM port is fixed at 9600 baud, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits and no parity.
Be sure the TNC is configured to these parameters.  You can use the terminal
program "minicom" that comes with Linux to prepare the TNC.  Make sure the
TNC is NOT in KISS mode.<p>
 
Be sure the device ( dev/ttyS* ) has the proper read/write permissions or the
server will not be able to access it. <p>

Root can set the serial port so it can be written to by anyone
with the following command: <p>

	chmod ugo+w /dev/ttyS0 <p>
	

NOTE: If you don't define a device for the com port in the aprsd.conf
file all TNC related functions in the server are disabled.<p>



<hr>

</a>

<a name="shutdown">
<h3>SHUTTING DOWN THE SERVER WHEN RUNNING AS A PROGRAM</h3>


Ctrl-C or "q" will shut down the server in an
 orderly manner and saves the current history
list (last 30 mins of received TNC data) to disk.<p> 

Ctrl-\ shuts down without saving anything.<p>

Note: The server also saves the history list (history.txt) to disk 
      every 10 minutes automatically. <p>

<a name="remotetnc">
<h3>
REMOTE TNC SYSOP ACCESS - (ESC)
</h3>

You may telnet to the APRS server and connect to the TNC for the purpose
of changing parameters or even sending data out over the radio channel.
Use the (ESC) key from a telnet session to enter remote access mode.
Some Telnet programs send data a line at a time so the (ESC) character
will not be sent until you hit the (Enter) key. <p>
  
You'll be prompted for your user name and password.  
These must match an entry in the Linux password file. In other
words, a valid Linux login user/password.  If the password is incorrect
remote sysop mode will be exited. The user must	also
belong to the "tnc" group.  This group must be created
in the /etc/group file. Here is an example line: <p>

tnc::102:root,wa4dsy,bozo <p>

In this example users root,wa4dsy and bozo are assigned to the tnc group.<p>



After you have logged on, everything you type goes to the TNC and
all TNC output data goes only to you.  The TNC is effectivly disconnected
from all other internet users.  Hit control-C to get the TNC into command mode. <p>

 
To exit remote TNC access hit the <ESC> key.  You may also need to
hit <Enter> if your Telnet program sends data a line at a time.	Some
Telnet programs can be configured for character at a time mode.  Check
your documentation for details.<p>

REMEMBER TO ENTER THE TNC "K" COMMAND BEFORE YOU EXIT.<p>

To disconnect hit ctrl-D . <p>

You can also use the "less" program to view it.
After entering "less /home/aprsd2/aprsd.log" you type "F" to
follow it in real time.  Type ctrl-C to exit "F" mode. <p>

All 3rd party station to station messages relayed from the Internet 
to RF are logged in /home/aprsd2/stsm.log <p>

3rd party formatted packets received by the TNC will never
be sent anywhere. <p>

Data from the UDP port are logged in /home/aprsd2/udp.log .<p>

All data heard on RF with the "MYCALL" callsign with be logged
in rf.log .  This feature lets you see what you have sent out
on RF if you are being digipeated by someone else. <p>

To keep the log files from getting too large they need to 
be rotated on a regular basis.  Add the following to your
/etc/logrotate.conf file.  Log files will be rotated 
daily or weekly and the oldest deleted after 4 rotations.
Feel free to modify the schedule to suit your needs. <p>

<pre>

/home/aprsd2/aprsd.log {
        weekly
        rotate 4
}

/home/aprsd2/stsm.log {
        daily
        rotate 4
}
/home/aprsd2/udp.log {
        daily
        rotate 4
}
/home/aprsd2/rf.log {

<h3>

STATION TO STATION MESSAGES
</h3>

This program will reformat and relay aprs 
station to station messages from the Internet 
to the TNC for RF transmission under the following
conditions. <p>

It came from a logged on verified registered user. <p>

 and <p>
 
 The originator was not seen on the TNC RF data stream
 in the past 30 minutes.<p>
 
 and   <p>
 
 The destination HAS been seen on the TNC RF data stream
 in the past 30 minutes and doesn't have "GATE*" in his path
 and has been repeated less than 3  times.  <p>
 
 and <p>

 The line "rf-allow yes" is in the /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file. <p>

Version 2.0.8 and later allows you to define up to 64 message destination call signs
or aliases which will always be gated to RF if "rf-allow yes" has been defined.
See the example aprsd.conf file for an example of how to use the "msgdest2rf"
command to enable this feature.
 
For each 3rd party messge delivered to RF the latest position report
packet of the originating station will also be sent after reformating
the path in 3rd party format.  The program pulls the posit from the
history list if it's in there. <p> 

eg: <p>

KE6DJZ>AP0917,KB6TLJ-5,RELAY,WIDE:=3415.99N/11844.34WyAPRS+SA <p>


becomes:<p>

}KE6DJZ>AP0917,TCPIP,WA4DSY*:=3415.99N/11844.34WyAPRS+SA  <p>

(assuming "MyCall" is WA4DSY ) <p>

During a series of messages the position packet will only
be sent with a message every 10 minutes unless the station emits and new one.<p>


This server will NOT igate a 3rd party _reformatted_ 
message from RF to the Internet.  This is strictly one way. <p>


Users of unregisterd client programs can send their own
station-to-station messages to other Internet users.  These
messages will not go out on the TNC RF channel and the path
will be modified (TCPIP is changed to TCPXX*) so other
hubs will know not to send these messages out on their RF
channels.  Unregistered users cannot Igate packets other
than their own.  In other words, the ax25 source call 
in their packets must match their logon call and "TCPIP" must
be in the path. (TCPIP* or TCPXX* will not work either) <p>

eg; assume N0CLU is unregistered and attempts to send
the following into the server.<p>

N0CLU>APRS,TCPIP:>TESTING <br>     
This will be converted to  N0CLU>APRS,TCPXX*:>TESTING
and gated to other users (but not to RF!) <p>

However... <br>
W4ZZZ>APRS,TCPIP:>TESTING <br>
or<br>
N0CLU>APRS,TCPIP*:>TESTING <br>
will be deleted and not sent anywhere.<br>


Telnet users must provide a user name or call sign
before any of their data can be relayed to the internet.
They need to enter "user callsign pass -1" so the server will
accept the data.  The ax25 FROM call in packets they send
must match the call sign they loggon with.  If they provide
a valid password full priviliges are granted since they
used the keyboard to emulate a client program logon string.
(Not that anyone would want to do this except for testing) <p>

This server will also accept valid user/password combinations
for the Linux system it is running on.  These users must be in
the aprs group.  This group can be added by editing the /etc/group file. <p> 

Note: <p>

This program trusts other versions of itself and APRServe to
flag the paths of data from unregistered Internet users with "TCPXX*".
Station to station messages flagged this way will not be sent out on RF.
The IGATE commands in the aprsd.conf file should specify a remote host port
which is secure. For IGATES it must be a port which doesn't echo any
Internet user data, only TNC data.  Full function servers such as APRServe
and this version (2.x.x) of aprsd will change TCPIP* to TCPXX* in the paths 
of unregistered users on  all ports. <p>

Users of the current java APRS applet don't log at all and are granted read-only access<p>

<a name="msgacks">
<h3>MESSAGE ACKS   (New in 2.0.7)</h3>
At the suggestion of Bob Bruninga I have implemented redundent message acks.
Message packets of the form "WA4DSY>APRS::W4XYZ    :ack{1" will be reformatted to
3rd party format and sent to the TNC as usual. However, the packet will be repeated
several times at intervals of 5 (typical) seconds.  The number of repeats and the time
between them are defined by the "ackrepeats" and "ackrepeattime" statements
in the aprsd.conf file.  The defaults are 2 repeats at 5 second intervals.
You can set the repeats to any value from 0 to 9 and the time interval
from 1 to 30 seconds.  Note the "ackrepeats" value is in additon to the
first message ack.  You will always send at least one.
<p>

<a name="validate">
<h3>USER VALIDATION</h3>

I obtained the user validation code from Steve Dimse K4HG.  He will
not allow the source code to be released.  To comply I have compiled
it as a linkable object file which is linked into aprsd at compile time.
You will find it in aprsd210/lib/validate.o  .  
<p>
If the users name and pass code aren't valid the validate module tries the Linux
pass word validator for the "aprs" group.  It that also fails
it waits 10 seconds then returns the bad news to aprsd which notifies the user. <p>
<em> NOTE: aprsd must be run as root for the Linux password validator to work.
</em>
However, the APRS user and passwords (from Mac/WinAPRS users) 
will be properly tested regardless of what user is running aprsd.
<br>
<p>

The logon format:  <p>

user <call sign> pass <pass code> vers <Program version><p>

eg: user N0CLU pass 00001 vers MacAPRS 3.0<br> 
might be sent by a MacAPRS user. <br>

As pass code of -1 means you are an unregistered user,
not a hacker trying out an bogus password. <p>

You can telent to a port and enter the following,
assuming your Linux user name is bozo and you password is
xyzzy and you are part of the aprs group as defined in
the /etc/group file. <p>

user bozo pass xyzzy <p>

To monitor some server status data you can enter: <p>

user bozo pass xyzzy vers monitor  <p>

The aprs data stream is turned off and "Monitor Mode" is entered.
Once a minute the server will send a status message to you.<p>

Once you have logged on, ctrl-D will not cause a disconnect.
You have to use your Telnet escape key then do a quit.
I had to do this to prevent inadvertant disconnects due to
possible spurious control codes in some users data. <p>

<h3>
KEEPING ABUSERS OUT OF THE SYSTEM (New in 2.1.0)
</h3>
You can put the call signs of the users you want to
restrict in the users.deny file.  The format is 
the users call sign followed by either
the letter "L" or "R".  The "L" prevents logons and RF access.
The "R" prevents only RF access while allowing the user to
send packets into the aprs network.
<p>
<pre>
user.deny example:

W4EVIL L   <--- Prevents sending of packets into the server or RF
W4SOB R    <--- Prevents any of his packets from getting on RF
		even if the came from another igate.


NOTE: This file is read every time aprsd needs to check users
so you will NOT need to restart the server when you change it.

<a name="inet2rf">
<h3>
Full time gating of selected stations from Internet to RF</h3>

For special events or personal reasons it may be desirable
to allow the transfer of packets of selected stations from
the Internet to RF.  Allowing all stations to do this would
overload the 1200 baud VHF packet frequency and isn't allowed.
These packets are only sent on RF if they came from the Internet
and were NOT heard on the local VHF frequency.<p>

There are three "modes" of doing this.  The most permissive
allows all packets from a selected station to be sent to RF
in real time.  The second mode only allows position report packets
to be sent on RF every 14.9 minutes.  This puts much less strain
on the RF network and is the recommended mode.<p>

The third mode which was new in version 2.0.8 gates 3rd party station
to station messages to RF full time if the DESTINATION call sign or alias
is defined in the aprsd.conf file after the msgdest2rf keyword.<p>


You select the stations by entering them in the /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file.
Up to 64 stations can be defined. Several can be put on each line.
The server must be restarted before any changes to aprsd.conf take effect. <p>


Examples:<br>
<pre>
These stations posits are sent to RF every 15 minutes: 
posit2rf K4HG-8 N4NEQ-9 
posit2rf W7LUS-14

All packets from this station are gated to RF full time.
gate2rf N0CLU-9



This allows any message addressed to SCOUTS, KIDS or CQGA to go to
RF even though these "call signs" were not heard locally.
msgdest2rf SCOUTS KIDS CQGA

</pre>


Note: The posits of stations in the "posit2rf" list are sent at 14 second
intervals.  It takes 14.9 minutes to scan the list of 64 before it repeats.
The posits are taken from the 30 minute history list.  If no posit
is available for the station then no data is transmitted.

<h3>

MIC_E PACKET TRANSLATION </h3>

Compressed TAPR Mic_E packets are converted to standard APRS format
before being sent anywhere else. I used the Mic_E decoder written by
Alan Crosswell, N2YGK to do the conversion. This is the same code that's
in his aprsmon program. <p>
The unconverted raw Mic_E packets from the local TNC 
can be observed by telneting to port 14580.
<hr>
</a>


<a name="aea_tapr">
<h3>AEA to TAPR conversion </h3>

All packets in the AEA format are converted to TAPR format 
before any other processing.  Clients never see an AEA
formatted packet except from the RAW TNC port (14580) if the system
operator is using an AEA TNC. <p>
<hr>
</a>

<a name="udp">

<h3>UDP PORT</h3>

The UDP input port (default 1315) is provided for interface with
scripts.  Only IP addresses listed in the "trust" line(s) in the
aprsd.conf file are can send data to this port.  You can enter
up to 20 trust commands. <p>

Example: <br>
<pre>
trust 198.162.50.5 <p>
</pre>
You may also provide a subnet mask after the ip address
to open up an entire sub net. The example below allows
16 address from 198.162.50.0 to 198.162.50.15 .<p>

Example:<br>
<pre>
trust 198.162.50.0 255.255.255.240 <p>
 </pre>
The script can format packets to be sent to the TNC for RF transmission
or TCPIP.  The routing is determined by the "TO-CALL" field.  If it's
"TNC" the packet goes on on RF via the TNC after the path is striped off. <p>

This goes to the TNC:  WA4DSY>TNC:Data for TNC here <br>
This goes to TCPIP:    WA4DSY>APRS:Data for the Internet <p>

The complete string including the path goes out on the Internet. <p>

See the file "udp_example" for a sample perl script.  <p>

<a name="queries">
<h3>
RESPONDING TO QUERIES	(New in 2.1.0)
</h3>
The aprsd server will respond to aprs queries as follows:<br>

query:<br>
WA4DSY>APRS:?IGATE? <br>
or<br>
WA4DSY>APRS::IGATE    :?IGATE?{0<br>
or<br>
WA4DSY>APRS::aprsd    :?IGATE?{0<br>
or<br>
WA4DSY>APRS::aprsdATL :?IGATE?{0 <br>

The first three examples will cause ALL aprsd servers to respond.
The last will get you a response only from the aprsdATL server.

The server first sends and ack packet the station initiating the query
then sends response data such as the following example:
<pre>
aprsdATL>APRS,TCPIP*::WA4DSY   :WA4DSY Atlanta_GA www.wa4dsy.radio.org sysop@mail.net aprsd 2.1.0 {1
</pre>
Most of the data comes from the aprsd.conf file.<br>
<ul>
<li> WA4DSY = mycall
<li> Atlanta_GA = mylocation
<li> www.wa4dsy.radio.org = host name obtained from Linux OS
<li> sysop@mail.net = myemail
<li> aprsd 2.1.0 = internal version number string.
<li> {1 = sequence number
</ul>

<h3>
KNOWN BUGS
</h3>
<h3>
Memory Leak
</h3>

Under RedHat 5.1 this program leaks 8K of memory for each user
connect/disconnect event.  This appears to be a problem with one or more
C libraries in the thread creation/destruction code. 
It has been fixed in 5.2. <p>

To get the fix for 5.1surf over to  
<a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/upgrades/5.1/i386/">
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/upgrades/5.1/i386/ </a><p>

Then get this file: <br>

glibc-2.0.7-19.i386.rpm <p>

The memory leak seems to be fixed in this version.
To install do:  rpm -U  glibc-2.0.7-19.i386.rpm
then reboot. You don't need to recompile aprsd! <p>



<h3>Dup filter problem</h3>

The duplicate filter sometimes fails to detect duplicates.  This
is an interaction with the quota system.  eg: When a message packet
"A" is followed by another message packet "B" followed by a duplicate
of "A" (all within 30 seconds) the second "A" packet will not be
recognized as a duplicate  because the "B" packet is of the 
same type (message) and replaced "A" due the quota system 
allowing only one message packet per user  in the history list.
Since the first instance of "A" is not present anymore the 
second "A" is not seen as a duplicate.   This problem
is not serious enough to require fixing at this time. <p>
