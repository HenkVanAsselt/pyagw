<H2> aprsd TCP port functions for versions 2.0.x  Oct 1998</H2>

<p>

All port numbers are defined in /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf.  If a port is not
defined there it is inactive.

<h3>Main Port #10151 (or System operator defined)** </h3>
<ul>
<li>aprsd.conf key word: mainport
<li>Function: User access via various aprs clients to all data streams.
<li>Bidirectional
<li>echos:
<ul>
<li>Internet user data
<li>Data from other IGATES and hubs
<li>TNC data
<li>Internal system status messages
<li>UDP data
</ul>
<li>Sends 30 minute* history of all  data streams when user connects

</ul>


<h3>Main Port-NH #10152 (or System operator defined)** </h3>
<ul>
<li>aprsd.conf key word: mainport-nh
<li>Same as Main Port above but <em>doesn't</em> send 30 minute history when user connects.
</ul>

		
<h3>Local Port #14579  (or System operator defined) </h3>
<ul>
<li>aprsd.conf key word: localport
<li>Function: User access via various aprs clients to local TNC data only.
<li>Bidirectional
<li>echos:
<ul>
<li>TNC data
<li>UDP data
<li>Internal system status messages
</ul>
<li>Sends 30 minute history of TNC data only
</ul>

<h3>
Raw TNC Port #14580  (or System operator defined)
</h3>
<ul>
<li>aprsd.conf key word: rawtncport
<li>Function: User access via various aprs clients to RAW local TNC data only.
<li>Bidirectional
<li>echos: TNC data
<li>No 30 minute history dump.
</ul>
Note: This port doesn't reformat the TNC data or
filter duplicates.  Every packet the TNC hears
is sent the the user unchanged.
<p>

<h3>
		
Link Port #1313  (or System operator defined)
</h3>
<ul>
<li>aprsd.conf key word: linkport
<li>Function:  Other hubs such as APRServe connect here 
to get local TNC data and Internet user data. 
<li>Unidirectional
<li>echos:
<ul>
<li>TNC data
<li>Internet user data (from other ports)
<li>UDP data
<li>Internal system status messages
</ul>
<li>Does NOT send 30 minute history
<li>Does NOT echo data from other IGATEs
</ul>
		

<h3>
Messsage Port #1314 (or System operator defined)
</h3>
<ul>
<li>aprsd.conf key word: msgport
<li>Function: Other hubs such as APRServe or aprsd connect here
			  to get 3rd party station to station messages.
			  All station to station messages from all data sources
			  and a corresponding position report are available
			  on this port.	 All other packets are filtered out.
			  This is useful for clients that need to conserve
			  Internet link bandwidth but want access to the
			  global station to station message stream
			  for Internet to RF messaging.
			  			  
<li>Unidirectional
<li>echos:
<ul>
<li>3rd party staton to station messages from all sources.
</ul>
<li>Does NOT send 30 minute history.
</ul>

<h3>
UDP Port #1315 or defined by system operator
</h3>
<ul>
<li>aprsd.conf key word: udpport
<li>Function:  Allows other programs such
as Perl scripts to send          				
short packets of data into       				
the aprs stream or the TNC.      				
Packets addressed to the TNC     				
are directed to RF.  All others  				
go to the Internet. I use it to  				
inject weather packets from      				
a Perl script.<br>
The path data (up to and including the colon) are stripped off before the TNC gets it.
<br>
eg: <br>
WA4DSY>TNC:This data goes to the TNC
<br>
WA4DSY>APRS:This whole line goes to the Internet (no path stripping)                   				
<br>
				
<li>Unidirectional (Input only)
		
<li>echos:  nothing
			
<li>       	security: System operator defines IP addresses
			  of trusted users. These will usually
			  be a local host or subnet but could be any host.
			  				
</ul>
<h3>
IGATE connection ports	
</h3>			
These are client ports which connect to distant                		
IGATEs to harvest their data streams. Connections              		
are reestablished when they drop.   The system                 		
operator defines the domain names and optional user/pass logon.		
If the optional user/pass information is supplied the          		
server will send out to the distant IGATEs the                 		
same data provided by port 1313 above.  This is usefull        		
for those who use a dialup connection without a static IP      		
address.   Up to 20 distant IGATES can be defined.             		
(this limit can be increased by editing an recompiling)        		
                                                               
<p>
<hr>

* The 30 minute time is now user definable.
<br>
** All ports are optional.  They will not be activated
   unless a port number is defined in the aprsd.conf file.
<hr>


<h3>REFORMATTING </h3>


Mic-E packets are converted to standard APRS format before being
sent to clients.<p>

Data from AEA TNCs is converted to TAPR format before being sent
to clients. <p>
  
<hr>
<h3>
Station to station messages of the 3rd party kind:
</h3>

This program will reformat and relay aprs 
station to station messages from the Internet 
to the TNC for RF transmission under the following
conditions.
<p>
<br>
If it came from a logged on verified registered user.
<br>
 <em>and</em>
<br> 
 The originator was not seen on the TNC RF data stream
 in the past 30 minutes.
<br> 
 <em>and</em>
<br> 
 The destination HAS been seen on the TNC RF data stream
 in the past 30 minutes and doesn't have "GATE*" in his path
 and has been repeated less than 3  times.
<p> 
For each 3rd party messge delivered to RF the latest position report
packet of the originating station will also be sent after reformating
the path in 3rd party format.  The program pulls the posit from the
history list.  
<p>
eg:
<br>
KE6DJZ>AP0917,KB6TLJ-5,RELAY,WIDE:=3415.99N/11844.34WyAPRS+SA
<br>
becomes:
<br>
}KE6DJZ>AP0917,TCPIP,WA4DSY*:=3415.99N/11844.34WyAPRS+SA
<br>
(assuming "MyCall" is WA4DSY )
<p>
During a series of messages the position packet will only
be sent with a message every 10 minutes unless the station emits a new one.

<p>
This server will NOT igate a 3rd party <em>reformatted</em>
message from RF to the Internet.  This is strictly one way.
<p>

Users of unregisterd client programs can send their own
station-to-station messages to other Internet users.  These
messages will not go out on the TNC RF channel and the path
will be modified (TCPIP* is changed to TCPXX*) so other
hubs will know not to send these messages out on their RF
channels.  Unregistered users cannot Igate packets other
than their own.  In other words, the ax25 source call 
in their packets must match their logon call.
<p>
eg; assume N0CLU is unregistered and attempts to send
the following into the server.
 <p>
N0CLU>APRS,TCPIP:>TESTING      
This will be converted to  N0CLU>APRS,TCPXX*:>TESTING
and gated to other users (but not to RF ever!)
<p>
However...
W4ZZZ>APRS,TCPIP:>TESTING
will be deleted and not sent anywhere.
<p>

Telnet users must provide a user name or call sign
before any of their data can be relayed to the internet.
They need to enter "user callsign pass -1" so the server will
accept the data.  The ax25 FROM call in packets they send
must match the call sign they loggon with.  If they provide
a valid password full priviliges are granted since they
used the keyboard to emulate a client program logon string.
(Not that anyone would want to do this except for testing)
<p>
This server will also accept valid user/password combinations
for the Linux system it is running on.  These users must be in
the aprs group.  This group can be added by editing the /etc/group file.  
See the README for details.
<p.
Note: 
<p>
This program trusts other versions of itself and APRServe to
flag the paths of data from unregistered Internet users with "TCPXX*".
Station to station messages flagged this way will not be sent out on RF.
The IGATE commands in the aprsd.conf file should specify a remote host port
which is secure. For IGATES it must be a port which doesn't echo any
Internet user data, only TNC data.  Full function servers such as APRServe
and this version (2.x.x) of aprsd will change TCPIP* to TCPXX* in the paths 
of unregistered users on  all ports.
